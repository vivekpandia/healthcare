# Health Data Storage & Access

## 📌 Project Description
"Health Data Storage & Access" is a blockchain-based solution for securely storing and managing patients' medical records. This system allows authorized parties (like doctors or hospitals) to add and retrieve health records while maintaining privacy, transparency, and data ownership.

## 🎯 Project Vision
To empower individuals with ownership and control over their medical data while providing authorized health professionals secure and easy access, thereby ensuring trust, integrity, and interoperability in healthcare.

## 🌟 Key Features
- ✅ **Secure Storage**: Records are stored on the blockchain with time-stamped entries.
- 🔒 **Access Control**: Only the owner or authorized personnel can view or add health data.
- 👨‍⚕️ **Authorized Access**: Admin (contract owner) can grant/revoke access to healthcare providers.
- ⏱️ **Timestamping**: Each record is automatically tagged with a timestamp for traceability.
- 👁️ **Transparent Retrieval**: Patients can view their own medical history anytime.

## 🔮 Future Scope
- 🌐 Integration with decentralized identity (DID) systems for patient verification.
- 🏥 Linking to hospital databases for seamless EMR import/export.
- 📱 User interfaces (mobile/web apps) for easy interaction.
- 🧠 AI integration for health analytics and smart suggestions.
- 🛡️ Encryption and IPFS-based off-chain data handling for scalability.
